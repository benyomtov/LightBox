#LightBox

##Description

This application is a front-end art toy designed for both desktop and mobile screens. I wanted to create something that was simple enough for anyone to use, but powerful enough that more artistically-inclined folks could use it to create artwork. It was developed using React, Canvas API, as well as several other technologies.

##Installation

This application requires no installation, can run on any browser, as well as almost any screen. Users can access the webtoy at https://benyomtov.github.io/LightBox.

##Usage

Upon entering the website, the user is presented with the title screen. The user can change the color scheme of this application by moving the mouse around the screen. Once inside the main app, the user is presented with a blank canvas, a home button that leads back to the title, and a toolbar that can be expanded, as well as dragged. Inside the toolbar are several settings the user can manipulate. There are settings for line thickness, shape, and color, as well as for glow size/color. There is a pause button that prevents drawings from gradually disappearing from the screen, as well as Draw Mode and Mobile Mode, which require the user to click and touch the screen to draw, respectively. There is also an Add Background button that allows the user to upload an image as the background of the canvas, as well as a Download button that saves the canvas to the user's device.
